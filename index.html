          <h2>Flex container</h2>
          <p>To create a Flexbox layout, you first need to create a container element and set its display property to "flex". This makes the container a Flex container and all its direct children become Flex items.

        <div>
          <h2>Flex items</h2>
          <p>The elements inside a Flex container are called Flex items. By default, Flex items are laid out in a row (horizontally). You can also change the direction to column (vertically) using the "flex-direction" property.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Flex axis</h2>
          <p>The main axis is the primary axis along which Flex items are laid out. By default, it's horizontal for a row layout and vertical for a column layout. The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis.
